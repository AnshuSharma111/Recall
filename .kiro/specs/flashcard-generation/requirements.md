# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Recall flashcard generation system - a desktop application that automatically converts study materials (PDFs and images) into high-quality flashcards using AI. The system emphasizes privacy, offline-first functionality, and intelligent content extraction to create diverse question types tailored to the source material.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to upload PDF documents and images to automatically generate flashcards, so that I can efficiently create study materials without manual card creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THEN the system SHALL convert each page to images for processing
2. WHEN a user uploads image files (JPG, PNG) THEN the system SHALL process them directly without conversion
3. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file types and reject unsupported formats
4. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates via WebSocket connection
5. IF file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with specific failure reasons

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student studying technical subjects, I want the system to accurately extract text and mathematical formulas from my documents, so that my flashcards include precise mathematical content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL use layout detection to identify text blocks, formulas, tables, and images
2. WHEN mathematical formulas are detected THEN the system SHALL use specialized OCR for formula recognition
3. WHEN text extraction is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve the relationship between text and associated images/diagrams
4. WHEN inline formulas are found THEN the system SHALL avoid duplication in the extracted content
5. IF OCR processing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with available content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to generate diverse types of flashcards (basic Q&A, cloze deletion, true/false, multiple choice), so that I can practice different learning methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL create at least 4 different question types: flashcard, cloze, true_false, and multi_choice
2. WHEN creating cloze deletion cards THEN the system SHALL identify key terms and create appropriate fill-in-the-blank questions
3. WHEN generating multiple choice questions THEN the system SHALL provide 4 options with one correct answer
4. WHEN creating questions THEN the system SHALL include relevant tags for categorization and filtering
5. WHEN images are relevant to questions THEN the system SHALL include image references in the flashcard data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student concerned about privacy, I want the application to work primarily offline and store my data locally, so that my study materials remain private and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL run a local Python server for processing
2. WHEN documents are processed THEN the system SHALL store all data in local directories
3. WHEN flashcard decks are created THEN the system SHALL save them as local JSON files
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files while preserving final outputs
5. IF the local server fails to start THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want to browse and manage my created flashcard decks through an intuitive desktop interface, so that I can easily access and organize my study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a grid view of existing flashcard decks
2. WHEN deck creation is requested THEN the system SHALL open a dialog for file selection and deck naming
3. WHEN files are being processed THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators and status updates
4. WHEN a deck is selected THEN the system SHALL load and display the deck contents
5. WHEN deck creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to generate high-quality, contextually relevant questions that don't hallucinate information, so that my flashcards are accurate and useful for studying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating questions THEN the system SHALL base all content strictly on the extracted text and images
2. WHEN creating answers THEN the system SHALL not introduce information not present in the source material
3. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL maintain context relationships between related concepts
4. WHEN questions are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they are appropriate for the subject matter
5. IF question generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing remaining content

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student using the application, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can understand and resolve any issues that occur during processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages
3. WHEN the system encounters recoverable errors THEN it SHALL continue processing other content
4. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully and preserve any completed work
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a student, I want the system to handle various document formats and quality levels (including scanned and handwritten notes), so that I can use all my study materials regardless of their source.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing scanned documents THEN the system SHALL handle image-based PDFs effectively
2. WHEN encountering handwritten text THEN the system SHALL attempt OCR recognition with appropriate error handling
3. WHEN document quality is poor THEN the system SHALL process available content and report quality issues
4. WHEN mixed content types exist THEN the system SHALL handle text, images, tables, and formulas appropriately
5. IF content cannot be processed THEN the system SHALL skip problematic sections and continue with processable content
