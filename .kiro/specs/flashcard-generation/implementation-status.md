2. **Question Type Rendering** - Proper display for cloze, multiple choice, etc.
3. **Basic Deck Management** - Edit, delete, duplicate decks

### Medium Priority (User Experience)
1. **Settings Interface** - User preferences and configuration
2. **Search and Filter** - Find decks and cards easily
3. **Export Functionality** - Basic export to common formats

### Low Priority (Advanced Features)
1. **Spaced Repetition** - Study algorithm implementation
2. **Statistics and Analytics** - Study progress tracking
3. **Advanced Processing Options** - Batch processing, custom prompts

## 💡 CONCLUSION

The Recall application has an exceptionally solid foundation with approximately **85% of core functionality implemented**. The backend processing pipeline is production-ready, and the AI question generation system is sophisticated and robust. The main gap is in the user-facing study interface, which represents the final piece needed for a complete MVP.

The architecture is well-designed for extensibility, making it straightforward to add the remaining features incrementally.
